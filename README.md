# Stock-Price-Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of a particular stock, NVIDIA ($NVDA) using its historical data. In addition, it will explore correlations between $NVDA$ with common market indices such as the DOW, S&P 500, NASDAQ, 10-year treasury yield, CBOE volatitlity index and others. It also explores how other commodities such as gold (GC=F) and crude oil affect the stock price. These historical data were organized and stored in the excel file DATA.xlsx. Note that the dataset can easily be adjusted to predict the prices of other stocks/commodities.
